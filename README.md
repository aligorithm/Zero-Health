#### Manual Database Reset
Reset the entire database and get fresh sample data:
```bash
# Interactive reset script
./scripts/reset-database.sh

# This will:
# - Stop all containers and remove volumes
# - Remove sample data markers
# - Rebuild containers from scratch
# - Automatically reinitialize fresh sample data
```
